          “FareShare,” “we,” “us” or “our”) governing your use of the FareShare
          applications, websites, technology, facilities, and platform
          (collectively, the “FareShare Platform”).
        </p>

        <p class="content">
          <strong>PLEASE BE ADVISED:</strong> THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROVISIONS
          THAT GOVERN HOW CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND FARESHARE CAN BE BROUGHT (SEE
          SECTION 17 BELOW). THESE PROVISIONS WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION,
          REQUIRE YOU TO: (1) WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND (2) SUBMIT
          CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST FARESHARE TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON
          AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS,

          Agreement, and/or by using or accessing the FareShare Platform, you
          expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement (including
          the dispute resolution and arbitration provisions in Section 17) and
          accept all of its terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS

          If you are accessing or using the FareShare Platform to access or use
          FareShare Business services on behalf of an organization contracted
          with FareShare, and you are not accessing or using the FareShare
          Platform as a Rider or Driver, your access and use is governed by the
          contract between FareShare and your organization.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">1. The FareShare Platform</h2>
        <p class="content">
          The FareShare Platform provides a marketplace where, among other
          things, persons who seek transportation to certain destinations
          (“Riders”) can be matched with transportation options to such
          destinations. One option for Riders is to request a ride from
          rideshare drivers who are driving to or through those destinations
          (“Drivers”). Drivers, Riders, and any other individuals, excluding any
          Excluded Individuals, using the FareShare Platform are collectively
          referred to herein as “Users,” and the driving services provided by
          Drivers to Riders, and other transportation related services provided
          by Drivers in connection with the FareShare Platform, shall be
          referred to herein as “Rideshare Services.” “FareShare Services” shall
          include any service provided by FareShare pursuant to the FareShare
          Platform (for clarity, FareShare Services does not include Rideshare
          Services or Third-Party Services).
        </p>

        <p class="content">
          As a User, you authorize FareShare to match and/or re-match you with
          Drivers or Riders based on factors such as your location, the
          requested pickup location, the estimated time to pickup, your
          destination, User preferences, ride mode, driver mode, membership
          status, regulatory or other third-party requirements, user statistics,
          and platform efficiency, and to cancel an existing match based on the
          same or other considerations. Any decision by a User to offer or
          accept Rideshare Services is a decision made in such User’s sole
          discretion. A separate agreement is formed between Drivers and Riders
          when the Rider accepts the Rideshare Services offered by the Driver.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
          As used herein, “Excluded Individuals” means any individual who is
          registering to use the FareShare Platform or whose use of the
          FareShare Platform is on behalf of an organization contracted with
          FareShare, except as a Rider or Driver. Your use of FareShare Services
          through the FareShare Platform may be subject to additional agreements
          between you and FareShare as applicable to the particular service in
          the particular market (“Supplemental Agreements”). Please review any
          applicable Supplemental Agreements carefully. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO
          BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT, YOU
          MAY NOT RENT OR USE FARESHARE SERVICES IN SUCH MARKET. In the event of
          any conflict between this Agreement and the terms and conditions of
          any Supplemental Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control,
          unless such Supplemental Agreement specifically states otherwise.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">2. Modification to the Agreement</h2>
        <p class="content">
          FareShare reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of
          this Agreement, and such modifications shall be binding on you only
          upon your acceptance of the modified Agreement. Continued use of the
          FareShare Platform after any such changes shall constitute your
          acceptance of such changes. Unless material changes are made to the
          arbitration provisions herein, you agree that modification of this
          Agreement does not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of
          arbitration (if applicable).
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">3. Eligibility</h2>
        <p class="content">
          The FareShare Platform may only be used by individuals who have the
          right and authority to enter into this Agreement and are fully able
          and competent to satisfy the terms, conditions, and obligations
          herein. The FareShare Platform is not available to Users who have had
          their User account temporarily or permanently deactivated. You may not
          allow other persons to use your User account, you agree that you are
          the sole authorized user of your User account, and you may not use
          your User account on behalf of any third party, except as otherwise
          expressly permitted by FareShare. To use the FareShare Platform, each
          User shall create a User account. Each person may only create one User
          account, and FareShare reserves the right to deactivate any additional
          or duplicate accounts. Your participation in certain FareShare
          programs and use of certain FareShare services may be subject to
          additional eligibility requirements as determined by FareShare. By
          becoming a User, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18
          years old. Individuals under the age of 18 are not permitted to create
          FareShare User or Driver accounts. Persons found to have done so will
          be deactivated immediately. Any use of the FareShare Platform must be
          by an adult 18 years or older. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you
          are the parent or legal guardian of a 16- or 17-year-old minor you may
          not create a User account for such minor to use the FareShare
          Platform.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">4. Charges</h2>
        <p class="content">
          As a User, you understand that request or use of Rideshare Services,
          FareShare Services, or Third-Party Services may result in charges
          (“Charges”) to you and/or to an organization, if applicable. Charges
          to Riders and/or organizations, if applicable, for Rideshare Services
          include Fares (defined below) and other applicable fees, tolls,
          surcharges, and taxes, plus any tips to the Driver that you elect to
          pay. FareShare has the authority and reserves the right to determine
          and modify pricing quoting to you a price for a specific ride at the
          time you make a request. Pricing may vary based on the type of service
          you request as described within the FareShare Platform. You are
          responsible for reviewing the price quote within the FareShare
          Platform and shall be responsible for all Charges incurred under your
          User account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the
          amounts thereof.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Rideshare Service Fares (“Fares”).</h3>
        <ul class="content list-item">
          <li>
            <strong>Quoted Fares:</strong> When you make a ride request using
            the FareShare Platform, FareShare will quote to you a Fare at the
            time of your request. The quote is subject to change until the ride
            request is confirmed. If your destination is not the same as the
            destination in your ride request, or the time or distance of your
            ride differs substantially from your quoted fare, or if you attempt
            to abuse the FareShare Platform, we may, at FareShare’s sole
            discretion and determination, cancel the fare quote and charge you a
            variable fare as described below. FareShare does not guarantee that
            the quoted fare price will be equal to a variable fare for the same
            ride. Quoted fares may include the Rideshare Service Fees and Other
            Charges below, as applicable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Variable Fares:</strong> Variable fares consist of a base
            charge and incremental charges based on the time and distance of
            your ride. For particularly short rides, minimum fares may apply.
            Please note that we use GPS data from your Driver’s phone to
            calculate the distance traveled on your ride. We cannot guarantee
            the availability or accuracy of GPS data. If we lose signal, we will
            calculate time and distance using available data from your ride. In
            addition to the variable fare, the total cost of your ride may
            include the Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges below, as
            applicable.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">
          Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges.
        </h3>
        <ul class="content list-item">
          <li>
            <strong>Service Fee:</strong> FareShare may charge a “Service Fee”
            for each ride.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Peak Time:</strong> At certain times, including times of
            high demand for Rideshare Services (“Peak Time”), you acknowledge
            that Charges may increase substantially. For quoted fares, we may
            factor Peak Time increases into the quoted price of the ride.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Priority Pickup and Wait & Save:</strong> In some cases, you
            may be able to select an expected pick up that is faster or slower
            than standard for a higher or lower Fare, respectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cancellation Fee:</strong> After requesting a ride, you may
            cancel it through the FareShare Platform, but note that in certain
            cases a cancellation fee may apply. FareShare may also charge a fee
            if you fail to show up after requesting a ride.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Damage Fee:</strong> If a Driver reports that you have
            materially damaged the Driver's vehicle, you agree to pay a “Damage
            Fee” of up to $250 depending on the extent of the damage (as
            determined by FareShare in its sole discretion), towards vehicle
            repair or cleaning. FareShare reserves the right (but is not
            obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages
            prior to processing the Damage Fee.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Abuse Fee:</strong> If we receive a credible report that you
            have misused or abused the FareShare Platform, you agree to pay an
            “Abuse Fee” of up to $250 as determined by FareShare in its sole
            discretion. FareShare reserves the right (but is not obligated) to
            verify or otherwise require documentation of abuse prior to
            processing the Abuse Fee.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tolls:</strong> In some instances, tolls, toll estimates, or
            return tolls may apply to your ride. We do not guarantee that the
            amount charged by FareShare will match the toll charged to the
            Driver, if any.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Other Charges:</strong> Other fees and surcharges may apply
            to your ride, including, but not limited to: actual or anticipated
            airport fees, state fees, local fees, event fees, fuel surcharges,
            wait time fees, or distance surcharges as determined by FareShare or
            its marketing partners. In addition, where required by law FareShare
            will collect applicable taxes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tips:</strong> Following a ride, you may have the
            opportunity to elect to tip your Driver in cash or through a desired
            method of you and your drivers choosing. The FareShare Platform does
            not offer tip options through the FareShare Platform. It is the
            Drivers sole responsibility to keep track of tips they receive, and
            report tips earned when filing their taxes.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Charges Generally.</h3>
        <ul class="content list-item">
          <li>
            <strong>Facilitation of Charges:</strong> All Charges are
            facilitated through a third-party payment processor. FareShare may
            replace its third-party payment processor without notice to you.
            Apart from tips and funds deposited in the In-App Wallet of
            FareShare, cash payments are strictly prohibited unless expressly
            permitted by FareShare. Your payment of Charges to FareShare
            satisfies your payment obligation for your use of the FareShare
            Platform, FareShare Services, Third-Party Services, and Rideshare
            Services. Certain Charges may be collectively billed as a single
            purchase transaction to your selected payment method based on the
            payment frequency indicated in your settings. If your primary
            payment method expires, is invalid, or if Charges to your primary
            payment method are unable to be processed for whatever reason, then
            you agree that FareShare may charge your other available payment
            methods in the FareShare Platform. If you don't recognize a
            transaction, then check your ride receipts and payment history.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Refunds:</strong> All Charges are non-refundable except
            to the extent required by law. This no-refund policy shall apply at
            all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage of the
            FareShare Platform, any disruption to the FareShare Platform,
            FareShare Services, Third-Party Services, or Rideshare Services, or
            any other reason whatsoever.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>In-App Wallet:</strong> You may deposit funds in your In-App
            Wallet which you can apply toward payment of certain Charges. Funds
            in the In-App Wallet are valid only for use on the FareShare
            Platform and are not transferable or redeemable for cash except as
            required by law. If the cost of your Charges exceeds the applicable
            In-App Wallet value, we may charge your payment method on file for
            the Charges in excess of the In-App Wallet amount. With respect to
            Fares, FareShare may deduct the amount attributable to the Service
            Fee, Tolls, or Other Charges before application of the In-App
            Wallet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Supplemental Charges:</strong> Charges related to FareShare
            Services may be further detailed in the applicable Supplemental
            Agreement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Third-Party Charges:</strong> If you choose to purchase
            Third-Party Services (described further in Section 20) through the
            FareShare Platform, you authorize your payment method on file to be
            charged according to the pricing terms set by FareShare or the
            third-party provider, or as otherwise provided in the terms of the
            purchased services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment Card Authorization:</strong> Upon addition of a new
            payment method or each request for FareShare Services, Rideshare
            Services, or Third-Party Services, FareShare may seek authorization
            of your selected payment method to verify the payment method, ensure
            the Charges will be covered, and protect against unauthorized
            behavior. The authorization is not a charge, however, it may reduce
            your available credit by the authorization amount until your bank’s
            next processing cycle. Should the amount of our authorization exceed
            the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to
            overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or prepaid
            card. FareShare is not responsible for these charges and is unable
            to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank. For
            clarity, FareShare does not charge a fee for Users to access the
            FareShare Platform, but retains the right to charge Users and/or
            organizations, if applicable, a fee or any other Charge for
            accessing or using FareShare Services, Rideshare Services, or
            Third-Party Services made available through the FareShare Platform.

        </h2>
        <p class="content">
          If you are a Driver, you will receive payment for your provision of
          Rideshare Services, specifically, one-hundred percent (100%) of the
          Fare and optional passenger tips. Further, you will receive a
          reoccurring bonus from Driver(s) that you caused, through a referral,
          to become a Driver in connection with the FareShare Platform upon
          their completion of a 30-day probationary period on the FareShare
          Platform. However, if one of those Drivers does not pay their
          Administrative fee, you will not receive a reoccurring bonus for that
          Driver. Drivers agree to automatically be charged administrative fees
          weekly to gain access to the FareShare Platform. Drivers who fail to
          pay their weekly administrative fees will immediately have their
          account deactivated and they must reapply to drive for the FareShare

          Platform can increase or decrease administrative fees with or without
          prior written notice.

            dispute that can lawfully be arbitrated, except for those claims and
            disputes which by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement are

            determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable with
            respect to any Claim or any particular remedy for a Claim (such as a
            request for public injunctive relief), then that Claim or particular

            from any remaining claims and/or remedies and may be brought in a
            court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall
            be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other
            Claims or remedies to the fullest extent possible.

            resolve a Claim must first send a written notice of the Claim to the
            other party describing the basis of the Claim and the relief sought.
            Notice to FareShare should be sent to FareShare, Inc., Attn: Legal

            arbitration. During this pre-arbitration period, you and FareShare

          In addition to connecting Riders with Drivers, the FareShare Platform
          may enable Users to provide services or receive services from other
          third parties (“Third-Party Services”). This Agreement between you and
          FareShare governs your use of the FareShare Platform in connection
          with the Third-Party Services. In addition, you understand that the
          Third-Party Services may also be subject to terms and pricing of the
          third-party provider (collectively, the “Third-Party Terms”) which
          will govern your relationship with such third-party provider, as
          applicable. You agree that FareShare is not responsible and may not be
          held liable for the Third-Party Services or the actions or omissions
          of the third-party provider. Such Third-Party Services may not be
          investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or
          completeness by FareShare, and FareShare is not responsible for any
          Third-Party Services accessed through the FareShare Platform. In the
          event of a conflict in the terms of any Third-Party Terms and this
          Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control with respect to
          FareShare and your agreements with FareShare herein, and the
          limitations of liability set forth in Section 15 above shall also
          apply to the third-party provider. The Dispute Resolution and
          Arbitration Agreement provisions in Section 17 above shall apply
          instead of any terms in any Third-Party Terms for all purposes except
          with respect to claims that are solely against the third-party
          provider.

        <div class="content">
          Except as provided in Section 17, this Agreement shall be governed by
          the laws of the State of Texas without regard to choice of law
          principles. This choice of law provision is only intended to specify
          the use of Texas law to interpret this Agreement and is not intended
          to create any other substantive right to non-Texans to assert claims
          under Texas law whether by statute, common law, or otherwise. If any
          provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid or non-binding, the
          parties shall remain bound by all other provisions of this Agreement.
          In that event, the parties shall replace the invalid or non-binding
          provision with provisions that are valid and binding and that have, to
          the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the invalid or
          non-binding provision, given the contents and purpose of this
          Agreement. You agree that this Agreement and all incorporated
          agreements may be automatically assigned by FareShare, in our sole
          discretion by providing notice to you. You may not assign this
          Agreement without FareShare’s prior written approval. Any purported
          assignment by you in violation of this section shall be void. This
          Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between
          you and FareShare with respect to the subject matter hereof and
          supersedes all previous understandings and agreements between the
          parties, whether oral or written.
